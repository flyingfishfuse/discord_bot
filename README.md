# discord_bot
 Chemical element resource database python library for discord/social_media/IRC bot
 
 This "bot" is really a collection of classes that will be able to perform many 
 useful chemistry and electronics engineering calculations. Caching lookup functions
 store pubchem and "composition" entries in a SQLite3 database.
 
 An emphasis on security is going to be made as well as clean code and good documentation. 
 
 The goal is to eventually have something that can communicate across arbitrary
 platforms and provide REAL value to people who cannot afford, or do not have time,
 to acquire pay-for-knowledge applications, by utilizing with open-source technologies and 
 providing the means to extend functionality by simple modifications to the code.

Functional:

 * mendeleev basic, physical, chemical, nuclear, historical, isotope , oxistates lookups
 * pubchem lookups
 * user input validation for pubchem lookup
 * database functions for inserting and recalling compounds
 
Working on: 

 * mendeleeve formatting
 * pubchem formatting
 * pubchem translation to chempy and ionize
 * user commands for inserting and recalling compositions

Planned:
 * Arbitrary communication platform IO
 * 2-d and 3-d molecule visualization in messages
 * electrochemistry calculators for plating and synthesis
 * reaction calculators involving time dependant systems
 * reaction calculators involving multi-variable systems

PIPE DREAMS:
 * Reaction calculators involving multi-variable time dependant systems with nanoscale interaction considerations

I dont know how to do teeny tiny letters on here so just pretend this is REALLY small PLEASE HELP DEAR LORD I NEED A TEAM OF PROGRAMMERS, I got the ideas under control but I really need people checking my work!
